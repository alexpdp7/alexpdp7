# Don't fear the Emacs

If you are here, you are probably thinking about adopting Emacs as your editor.
Perhaps you are facing analysis paralysis, wondering what's the best way to do it.

Just do it!
It's a bit alien at first, but I didn't need much time to do all my editing in Emacs.
I haven't learnt Emacs Lisp and I haven't adopted any large configuration package.

[My `emacs.el` right now is 130 lines](https://github.com/alexpdp7/alexpdp7/blob/4cbc783bbe406051bbcf88995316c9994518cbd9/emacs/emacs.el).
Perhaps when you read this, my current config will be much bigger..
But I'm definitely happy today with my 130-line config.

You can start without a configuration.
Whenever you can't do something, search Internet.
You will quickly learn the hotkeys you need the most.
Once you can search, undo, cut, copy, and paste, you can take your time with the rest.
Don't avoid the menus.
Sometimes it's just easier to hit F10 and find something in the menus.
You can also M-x to execute commands, like `indent-region`.

Many other stuff is support for things I do: Vale, Rust, Python, Java, YAML, Puppet.
You probably need other plugins, and maybe you don't need them right now.

Maybe try out some of the large configurations, to learn what fancy stuff is available and add it as you become comfortable with the previous thing you configured.

(Be sure to check [emacs.bash](https://github.com/alexpdp7/alexpdp7/blob/master/emacs/emacs.bash) for something you can source in your bash to keep Emacs running and prevent slow startup.)
