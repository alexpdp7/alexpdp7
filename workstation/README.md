I am trying to move my tools into Cosmopolitan binaries (only [Emacs](../scripts/p7s/emacs.py) at the moment), a [container image](build_workstation) for use with Distrobox, and [a Python module with tools](../scripts).

This includes:

* [My editor](../emacs)
* [A modern IRC setup](modern_irc.md).
* [mbsync to synchronize my email for backup](../scripts/p7s/mail/mbsync.py)
* [Some integration with vaultwarden for secrets](../scripts/p7s/bitwarden.py)
* And some other odds and ends (NextCloud, etc.)
