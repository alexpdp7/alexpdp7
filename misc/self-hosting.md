# Self hosting

https://xkcd.com/743/

I recall knowing people who were not programmers or system administrators doing "advanced" software things.
They would buy a domain with shared hosting, set up email addresses, or run a WordPress blog.

I see fewer people doing this today, although I see some groups setting up Mastodon servers as an alternative to Twitter.

## Gratis and libre

This text discusses some questions where the word "free" can be confusing.
People writing about these topics frequently want to separate things that have no cost from things that give you freedom.

A common convention is [gratis versus libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre).

This text uses "gratis" to mean "no cost".
This text does not discuss much freedoms directly.
In part, because defining and agreeing on freedoms is more difficult from defining and agreeing on what no cost means and what it entails.

## The danger of good gratis services

"If you're not paying for the product, you are the product" is a popular criticism of gratis services.
People use this saying to criticize gratis services selling your data.
However, I think that *good* gratis services create a more insidious problem.

[Dumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)) is not a recent invention.
Creating good gratis services reduces the incentive for competition and distorts the public perception.

Why would any care for providing email services if GMail is gratis and good?
This is a logical and fair reasoning.

However, the result of this reasoning is that nowadays, Google and Microsoft effectively control email.
Email is a fundamental Internet service that is critical to much more than it is immediately obvious.
How many services only allow you to reset your password through an email?

Due to GMail and that enterprises never considered alternatives to Microsoft Exchange, most email in the world now passes through Microsoft and Google.
This creates a vicious circle.
Microsoft and Google can raise the barrier to entry to provide email services, because they can refuse to process email.
(I am not saying they do this.
I am saying they *can* do this.)

Coincidentally, people are rejecting email more and more.
With this, people are rejecting one of the few remaining interoperable Internet services and moving into more proprietary services.
Surprisingly, a service where competition has severely reduced, sucks.

But also, even without Microsoft or Google blocking competition, running email is harder nowadays.
Because these companies dominate, other parties might not see improving email hosting as a rational effort to invest in.
There are little incentives to provide good ways to run your own email.

In the age of common people running their blogs with WordPress, despite its faults, the WordPress developers made sure that WordPress was easy to install on cheap shared hosting, and made a big effort to make updates easy.
Running a blog had security risks, but common people were able to run WordPress safely.
There were significant documentation and support resources so that you could own your blog.

I believe that running your own email is increasingly difficult.
What is the incentive to improve the situation if GMail will provide a good gratis service?

The incentive is that Microsoft and Google control email, and email stagnates and sucks compared to other services that are closed and not interoperable.

## All of this has happened before and will happen again

We have seen this happening and repeat constantly.
Randall Munroe's comic that opens this article was published in 2010, 14 years ago!

Today, I feel that people are migrating from Twitter to BlueSky.

Twitter was a good gratis service that allowed people to publish their thoughts for everyone to see.
Twitter has had hundreds of millions of users, and many large organizations have trusted Twitter for their public communication.

However, Twitter is a non-interoperable system controlled by a private company.
People and organizations have slowly allowed Twitter to control public discourse.

Many see Twitter now as a problem, and likely regret having ceded control to Twitter.

However, I feel that instead of trying something different, another private company like BlueSky will take the mantle and have significant power over public discourse.

Note that Twitter used to have a good public API that allowed others to deliver alternate clients and interoperate somewhat with Twitter.
I believe that Twitter providing those allowances helped them reach their dominant position.
But once Twitter was dominant, these allowances were not a net positive for Twitter anymore.
Therefore, Twitter rationally removed these allowances.

Why would BlueSky not do the same?

## The alternatives to good gratis services might not be "good"

Certainly, gratis good services are very convenient, and the alternatives are less convenient.

One alternative is paid services.
"If you're not paying for the product, you are the product" can mean that frequently paying for a service might turn out better for you in the long run.

Besides GMail, Google provided gratis photo storage.
Nowadays, people take a significant amount of photos and like to preserve them.
By using Google services, people could store their photos automatically and conveniently.

However, [on June 1, 2021, Google Photos introduced limits to this](https://blog.google/products/photos/4-things-know-about-google-photos-storage-policy-change/).
Many people scrambled for alternatives to store their personal photos.

In the past, some people paid for services like Flickr.
Others learned to preserve their photos through their own means.

However, after Google made a gratis and good service, many services like Flickr languish, and people find it alien to take care of storing their photos themselves or to pay for such service.

## We are prisoners

The prisoner's dilemma describes situations where people can choose to act in their own interest or collaborate with others.
I believe the prisoner's dilemma is present everywhere in our daily life and can explain many behaviors and situations.

Choosing a good gratis service is frequently good for our own interest in the short term.
Using alternatives to good gratis services is frequently more expensive and less convenient.

However, in the long run, good free services can become dominant and thus are worse.

Studies of the prisoner's dilemma discuss that when people face a prisoner's dilemma situation once, they are more likely to act in their own interesent.
However, when facing multiple rounds of such situations, they are more likely to collaborate.

We should observe the past and evaluate whether our past choices were good in the short term, but resulted in damaging dominance in the long term.

## Having no energies does not mean you are a bad person

Reading this you might feel that I'm criticizing those who choose convenience.

People have a limited amount of energy and time.
There are too many things to worry about in our lives.
We cannot evaluate every choice we make for the greater good.

However, I propose that we should at least consider for a minute when we choose services.
We can always evaluate who is providing the service, which are their incentives, and how this affects us.

We should also look at previous choices and how they turned out.
Perhaps back in the day we did not give second consideration to storing our pictures in Google Photos, or tweeting.
But would have we been better off if we had chosen other services?
Are we making similar choices today?

## The irony here

Right now, you are reading this text on GitHub.
GitHub has become the dominant platform for sharing code in the world because GitHub is free and good, causing many of the problems that this text describes.
Fortunately, GitHub is based on Git, which means migrating content off GitHub is not as bad as migrating off other free and good services.
