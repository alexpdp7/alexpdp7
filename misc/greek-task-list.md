### Icarian task

When you have a task you know you’re going to fail at anyways, so why not have some fun with it before it all comes crashing down

### Cassandrean task

When you have to deal with people you KNOW won’t listen to you, despite having accurate information, and having to watch them fumble about when you told them the solution from the start (most often witnessed in customer service)

Patroclean task: something that you have a wild misunderstanding of the difficulty involved in accomplishing properly and can only end terribly, but you dive into with your whole heart and the deep faith and conviction that you can accomplish it by sheer force of will.

### Penelopean task

You don't actually want the outcome of the task, so you're self-sabotaging in a clever and undetectable way to keep it from ever being completed.

### Orphean task

When you almost succeed, but lose everything the moment you turn around to check your progress.

### Daedalean task

When you’re forced to design something brilliant and functional… that you yourself will inevitably become trapped inside.

### Medusan task

When your project becomes so horrifying that everyone involved freezes in place rather than deal with it.

### Tantaline task

When success is right there, but bureaucracy or budget cuts keep snatching it away at the last moment, forever.

### Pandoran task

When fixing one small issue unleashes a thousand new ones, but hey — at least there’s still hope somewhere in the ticket backlog.

### Odyssean task

When the assignment technically has an end, but it’s buried under so many side quests that you forget what the original goal was.

### Narcissian task

When the entire effort is about maintaining appearances rather than achieving anything of substance.

### Promethean task

When you give people a powerful new tool that could transform their work — and are punished eternally for doing so.

### Orestian task

When the mess you’re cleaning up is the direct result of the last cleanup you performed.

### Thesean task

When the only way to finish is to disassemble everything piece by piece — until you’re no longer sure if what’s left is the same project you started.

### Achillean task

When your work is flawless except for that one fatal oversight that will, inevitably, destroy you.

### Penelopean task

When you diligently undo by night what you accomplish by day, just to keep the stakeholders pacified.

### Midasean task

When everything you touch turns into paperwork, compliance documents, or gold-plated nonsense nobody actually needs.

### Gordian task

Not intended to be actually done, but violence is the answer.
