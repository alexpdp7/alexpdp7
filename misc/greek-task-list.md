## Orphean task

When you almost succeed, but lose everything the moment you turn around to check your progress.

## Daedalean task

When you’re forced to design something brilliant and functional… that you yourself will inevitably become trapped inside.

## Medusan task

When your project becomes so horrifying that everyone involved freezes in place rather than deal with it.

## Tantaline task

When success is right there, but bureaucracy or budget cuts keep snatching it away at the last moment, forever.

## Pandoran task

When fixing one small issue unleashes a thousand new ones, but hey — at least there’s still hope somewhere in the ticket backlog.

## Odyssean task

When the assignment technically has an end, but it’s buried under so many side quests that you forget what the original goal was.

## Narcissian task

When the entire effort is about maintaining appearances rather than achieving anything of substance.

## Promethean task

When you give people a powerful new tool that could transform their work — and are punished eternally for doing so.

## Orestian task

When the mess you’re cleaning up is the direct result of the last cleanup you performed.

## Thesean task

When the only way to finish is to disassemble everything piece by piece — until you’re no longer sure if what’s left is the same project you started.

## Achillean task

When your work is flawless except for that one fatal oversight that will, inevitably, destroy you.

## Penelopean task

When you diligently undo by night what you accomplish by day, just to keep the stakeholders pacified.

## Midasean task

When everything you touch turns into paperwork, compliance documents, or gold-plated nonsense nobody actually needs.

## Gordian task

Not intended to be actually done, but violence is the answer.
