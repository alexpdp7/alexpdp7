# Setup

See [personal infrastructure](../personal_infra) for things I run on servers.

## Workstation hardware

I have two Windows machines; a pre-built gaming tower for gaming (connected to a TV) and a small Celeron PC in another location so that I always have some Windows PC physically available.

Besides my employer's workstations, I do most of my computing from two desktop computers in each location.

I have an old ThinkPad for tests, and a slow ChromeBook tablet with detachable keyboard.

## Software

I tend to use LTS Linux distributions.
Currently I use Debian Stable, for some time I used CentOS.

I use GNOME with [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM).

I use Firefox with LanguageTool, Bitwarden and NoScript.

* GNU Screen

* [Emacs](../emacs)
* Nextcloud (through rclone/WebDAV in some systems)
* VLC

* uv for Python development
* [`fx`](https://fx.wtf/) to explore JSON

* [Mutagen](https://mutagen.io/) for SSH sync
* mbsync + [my own terminal email client](https://github.com/alexpdp7/epistle) for mail backup and some reading
