About 200-300 MB per album CD when ripped to FLAC.

About 4-8 GB per disc, averaging 5.6 GB per movie as ISO.

About 20-50 GB per disc, averaging 37 GB per movie as ISO.

## Hardware

### Reader

I got a Verbatim external USB Blu-ray writer for about 120â‚¬.

### Storage

See <https://diskprices.com/>.

## Software

### Audio

* [abcde](https://abcde.einval.com/wiki/) claims to rip and compress to FLAC and tag automatically.

### Video

`pv` seems to be enough to create ISO.

[FindVUK](http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/) has the keys to rip Blu-ray discs.
