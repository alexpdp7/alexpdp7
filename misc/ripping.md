About 20-50 GB per disc, averaging 37 GB per movie as ISO.

## Hardware

I got a Verbatim external USB Blu-ray writer for about 120â‚¬.

### Storage

See <https://diskprices.com/>.

## Software

### Audio

* [abcde](https://abcde.einval.com/wiki/) claims to rip and compress to FLAC and tag automatically.

### Video

You can use `dd` to rip DVD and Blu-ray.
However, `dd` can fail on some disks, perhaps due to damage or copy protection.
[This post on unix.stackexchange describes a trick that works](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/642790):

* Start playback of the disc using [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).
* Try `dd` first, if it fails, then run a command like `ddrescue -n -b2048 -K1M /dev/sr0 x.iso x.map`.
* After `ddrescue` starts running, quit VLC.

[FindVUK](http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/) has the keys to rip Blu-ray discs.
However, with encrypted Blu-ray discs, you need to configure the keys in each device where you want to play back the content.

[blu-save](https://git.sr.ht/~shironeko/blu-save) can remove the encryption.
However, VLC is confused by the `AACS` and `CERTIFICATE` directories that blu-save copies to the output.
If you remove them, then VLC can play the `BDMV` directory with menus, etc.
