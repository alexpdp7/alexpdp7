# Internet communication channels

If you want to provide a communication channel for a community over the Internet and you are considering options such as:

* Slack
* Discord
* Reddit
* Telegram
* WhatsApp
* Facebook
* Or any other communication channel controlled by a single company

, then please read this article and consider an alternative.

Because such channels are convenient, cheap, and easy, they are natural choices.
However, because they are controlled by a single company, their benefits come as a tradeoff with some non-obvious problems.
This article lists alternatives below.

## The problems of communication channels controlled by a single company

The biggest problem is that companies want to earn money, not benefit their users.

Frequently, giving a convenient, cheap, and easy service makes it easier to earn money, but historically, companies ultimately put profit before the benefit of users.

### IRC

IRC is a real-time chat protocol created in 1988 that is still in use.
Many perceive flaws in IRC that seem to make it a bad choice.
However, many of the flaws in IRC have been addressed in recent times and I believe it is a good choice in many (but not all) scenarios.

The biggest traditional issue with IRC is channels without history, where you cannot see messages posted while you were offline.
(If you suspend or turn off your laptop, you will be offline in IRC.
Even if you run your IRC client continuously on your client, if your phone goes out of coverage or your phone suspends your IRC client, you will be offline.)
However, nowadays you can create channels with history.

(Note that many IRC channels still do not have history.
Channels without history are frequently confusing for new users, because most chat systems have history.
Heavy IRC users are either used to having no history [this might seem surprising, but for some this is even a benefit] or have means to be permanently connected to IRC.
However, users new to IRC might join a channel, post a question and go offline without anyone having a chance to see their message and reply.
Then, unless people remember to answer when they are back, or other means are used, answers will not be visible to the person who asked.)

Although this problem and others are solvable today, people who want to run a chat over IRC must know IRC well to set up a channel so that users have an intuitive experience.
(And in my opinion, running an IRC channel effectively is more difficult than running a chat channel with other systems.
However, the advantages of IRC outweigh the costs.)
