- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox][The Abilene paradox]] is a collective fallacy, in which a group of people collectively decide on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of most or all individuals in the group, while each individual believes it to be aligned with the preferences of most of the others.

* Lost and not found

Some articles I'd like to find here, but haven't been able to find again:

- Enqueuing function calls vs. extending your domain model.
  This article discussed using traditional queues for handling some actions in your application vs. doing this "declaratively".
  For example, enqueue "send notification about x to user y" vs. "add column 'needs_x_notification to users table".
  If I remember correctly, the article contained some insightful arguments for the latter approach I had not thought of.
