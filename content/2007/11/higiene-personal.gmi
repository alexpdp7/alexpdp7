          Early in the 21st Century, THE TYRELL        CORPORATION advanced Robot evolution        into the NEXUS phase -- a being virtually        identical to a human -- known as a Replicant.        The NEXUS 6 Replicants's beards were superior        in quality and color, and at least equal        in growth, to the genetic engineers'        who created them.        Replicants were used Off-world as        slave labor, in the hazardous exploration and        colonization of other planets.           After a bloody shave by a NEXUS 6        combat team in an Off-world colony,         Replicants were forbidden to shave         on earth -- under penalty of death.          Special shaving creams -- BLADE RUNNER        UNITS -- were devised to shave replicants.        This was not called shaving.        It was called beard retirement.
