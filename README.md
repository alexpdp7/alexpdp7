========

Maybe Github *is* the social network for coders.

PLAN
====

* https://github.com/alexpdp7/tvguide
 * iz3 is toying with writing an alternative frontend at https://github.com/iz3/PDPexto as a PHP learning project
 * I should get on with the program and write an alternative scraper (my source doesn't have all the channels I want, sincroguia does)
* https://github.com/alexpdp7/f1web
 * I need to add some more stuff, such as views to check scores!

* Make some screencasts showing how to set up an Eclipse + Java + Maven + Spring IoC + Spring JDBC + Spring MVC + PostgreSQL project

WORK
====

* Django!
