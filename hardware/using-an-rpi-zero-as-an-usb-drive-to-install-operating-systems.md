# Using an RPI Zero as an USB drive to install operating systems

If you install operating systems, then you might have suffered the annoyances of writing images to USB drives.
To write an operating system to a USB drive, you must wipe the entire contents of the USB drive.
So a USB drive can only contain a single operating system.

There are alternatives:

* iODD sells external USB drives that can emulate CDROM drives.
* netboot.xyz and other netboot images can boot operating systems over the network.
* Multiboot USB software like Ventoy or YUMI.

See https://github.com/alexpdp7/rpi-zero-usb-iso/ for a tool to do this with a Raspberry Pi.
