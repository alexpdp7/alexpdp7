# The content web manifesto

These are my recommendations for creating "content" websites.
In a content website visitors mostly read content.
Some example content websites are Wikipedia, news websites, and blogs.

## General guidelines

### Make content usable without JavaScript

By making your content usable without JavaScript, a content website automatically addresses most annoyances with content websites.

Websites that do not require JavaScript tend to require less resources, making them faster and lighter.

### Avoid relying on non-text content

Text content is uniquely flexible, it is frequently the most amenable media to being processed by the following systems and processes:

* Text-to-speech systems
* Translation (both human and automatic)
* Edition (making changes to text content)
* Quoting/embedding (readers can copy parts of your text to cite or promote your content)

Images, audio, video or other interactive media might be required to convey the message of your content.
Therefore, the content web manifesto does not forbid their use.
However, non-text content should always be accompanied by at least a text description of the content, and ideally, an alternate text version of the content.

### Provide granular URLs

When providing a significant amount of content, make sure readers can link to specific content of interest.

### Date content

Always make initial publication and edition dates available.
