# GitHub annoyances

## The repository creation wizard can be confusing initially

When creating a new repo, GitHub offers you to populate the repository with some files (a README, a `.gitignore` file, a license).

In some situations, you have an existing directory in your computer with files that you want to be the initial contents of the repo.
If you create a truly empty repo, then GitHub displays some instructions that can help pushing the contents of your existing directory to the new repo.
If you use the GitHub features to populate the repo, then GitHub does not display these instructions and uploading your files requires more knowledge.
