# Git advice

## Never use `git commit -m`, use `git commit -v`

Configure your system so that `git commit` opens your preferred editor.

With `git commit -v` you can see your commit diff while writing your commit message.
This helps you review that your commit is correct and write a better commit message.

## Use a global gitignore

See <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration.html#_core_excludesfile>.

I recommend that the `.gitignore` in a Git repository should only include files that the "supported" procedures for working of your repository generate.
For example, `.gitignore` should exclude files generated by running or compiling the project.

If your editor or operating system generates files in the repository, I suggest those are not excluded by the `.gitignore` in the repository, but on your personal global gitignore.

This is more efficient:

* You only have to add exclusions that you need once.
* The project `.gitignore` is smaller and requires less mental overhead to maintain.

## Use the modern Git commands (or teach them)

Particularly, `git checkout` has many functionalities that now can be handled by more focused commands like `git switch` and `git reset`.

If you have too much muscle memory and are used to them, then consider learning them only to teach other people so that they start with the safer commands.

Many Git commands print suggestions that use the newer commands.
